      At the Story Assisted Living Trainting Institute, our ambition is to provide those who could benefit from our expert's areas of
       expertise the chance to do so.
      <br><br>
      The Story Assisted Living Training institute is a project created by Memory Care and Caregiving experts with years of
      education in their field for the express purpose of delivering its partakers the knowledge that they will need
      to excel at providing these services.

      Jennifer is the instructor of each course, as well as the author of the Policies and Procedures that we offer.
      She has a degree in social work from Arizona State University and has been working as the owner of an assisted Living
      company for decades.
      <br><br>
      Over the years and throughout many experiences, both in classrooms and in the real world, she has gained the understanding
      and capabilities to play any role in the caregiving machine. Her education and love for the game is what caused her to want to 
      offer such courses to likeminded individuals.
